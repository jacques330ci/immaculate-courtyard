First tutorial project

Hello Colleagues!

I'm a semi-retired IT professional with the desire to become a freelance web developer. I am certified Microsoft partner (MCSA with previous MCSE certification).  Previous programming experience include COBOL, Fortran, dBase, Pascal, Perl, HTML, RBase, and MS SQL). Currently I am learning HTML5, CSS, Javascript, and C++. So I will be pretty busy.
